# Instructions

In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.
A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.

This will compile your code.

``` java
cmd C:\Users\Your Name>javac Main.java
```

to run the file:

``` java
cmd C:\Users\Your Name>java Main
```

- to create a directory:

```cd characters
   mkdir allies
```

- to create a file in a directory:

``` git
touch GhostBuster.java
```

## Generation of JavaDoc: -

To create a JavaDoc you do not need to compile the java file. To create the Java documentation API, you need to write Javadoc followed by file name.

``` git
javadoc file_name or javadoc package_name
```

After successful execution of the above command, a number of HTML files will be created, open the file named index to see all the information about classes.
